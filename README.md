<b>Wes Bos CSS Grid Course #GRIDDY Notes</b>

20th Feb 2018 - 

## Lesson 2: Starter Files and Tooling Setup
- CSS Variables help you to repeat CSS values conveniently
- using Border-box for box-sizing and everything else

## Lesson 3: CSS Grid Fundamentals
- Take an element, dice it into rows and columns (tracks) and put them into the grid layout
- need to set display:grid for the parent grid container
- gtr and gtc to decide on the rows and column sizes of the grid
- gtr and gtc can take in different formats of sizes
  > 100px 200px 100px
  > 100px 200px auto 100px
  > fr as percentages
- grid-gap is like margin between each 'track'

## Lesson 4: CSS Grid Fundamentals
- Tracks are numbered not by their columns/row number but by their start and end
- Explicit: dark-dashed line (we made those, explicit values)
- Implicit: dotted-lines (values determined by grid, we did not specify values)

## Lesson 5: CSS Grid Fundamentals
- Implicit Rows are created when there are not enough css values (2 value) for extra elements (3 rows of elements)
- grid-auto-rows > how big rows are if they are extra added (value for leftovers)
